  """Interprocess locking via fcntl and a pid file.

  We use fcntl to manage locks between processes, as the kernel will
  release the lock when the process dies no matter what, so it works
  quite well.

  We store the pid in the file we use so that 3rd party programs,
  primarily small shell scripts, can easily see who has (or had) the
  lock via the stored pid.  We don't clean the pid up on exit
  because most programs will have to check if the program is still
  running anyways.

  We can forcibly take a lock by deleting the file and re-creating
  it.  When we do so, we check if the pid in the file is running and
  send it a SIGTERM *if and only if* it has a commandline with
  'nsscache' somewhere in the string.

  We try to kill the process to avoid it completing after us and
  overwriting any changes.  We check for 'nsscache' to avoid killing
  a re-used PID.  We are not paranoid, we send the SIGTERM and
  assume it dies.

  WARNING:  Use over NFS with *extreme* caution.  fcntl locking can
  be configured to work, but your mileage can and will vary.
